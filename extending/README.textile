h1. Modules for rah_terminal

p. These modules optional and add new Terminal options to rah_terminal. All included modules in the directory can be installed as Textpattern's plugins. Easiest way to do so is to set up a "plugin cache directory,":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=Advanced_Preferences#Plugin_cache_directory_path and place any of the PHP files to it. Textpattern loads the files automatically, and most of the work is already done.

p. Modules included in the directory are as follows.

h2. textile.php

p. The module generates and prints out HTML markup from given Textile markup. Uses the Textile class included with Textpattern installation.

h2. markdown.php

p. The module generates and prints out HTML markup from given Markdown markup. Uses and requires "PHP Markdown":https://github.com/michelf/php-markdown/ library.

p. To configure PHP Markdown, download and upload @markdown.php@ to your server. Then to tell rah_terminal and Textpattern markdown.php's location, add a line to Textpattern's configuration file, /textpattern/config.php.

bc. define('rah_terminal__markdown', '/absolute/path/to/markdown.php');

p. The constant @rah_terminal__markdown@ should contain an absolute path to markdown.php file.
