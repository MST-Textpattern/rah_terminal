h1. Modules for rah_terminal

p. This directory contains collection of optional modules for rah_terminal. These modules add new terminal options to rah_terminal. All included modules can be installed as normal Textpattern plugins. Easiest way to do so, is to set up a "plugin cache directory,":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=Advanced_Preferences#Plugin_cache_directory_path and place any of the PHP files in it. Textpattern loads the files automatically and most of the work is already done.

p. Modules included in the directory are as follows.

h2. markdown.php

p. The module generates and prints out HTML markup from given Markdown syntax. Uses and requires "PHP Markdown":https://github.com/michelf/php-markdown/ library.

p. To configure PHP Markdown, download @markdown.php@ and upload it to your server. Then to tell rah_terminal and Textpattern markdown.php's location, add a line to Textpattern's configuration file, /textpattern/config.php.

bc. define('rah_terminal__markdown', '/absolute/path/to/markdown.php');

p. The constant @rah_terminal__markdown@ should contain an absolute path to markdown.php file.

h2. textile.php

p. Generates and prints out HTML markup from given Textile markup. Uses the Textile class included with your Textpattern installation.

h2. txpmarkup.php

p. Parses and prints out results of given Textpattern's @<txp:tag />@ markup.
